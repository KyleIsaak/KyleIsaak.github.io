            <p>The key parts of this prototype are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>UI free menu systems</li>
              <li>Functioning multiplayer</li>
              <li>Integration with Unreal's <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Online/Steam/">Steam Online Subsystem</a></li>
              <li>Efficient voxel-based terrain generation using <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/consume-everything-how-greedy-meshing-works/452717"> greedy meshing</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This prototype has fully-replicating multiplayer that works both with and without Steam. The version that is currently on Google Drive requires Steam to function,
              but this can be changed using just 2 lines of code, and will eventually be an option that users can select
            </p>

            <p>
              For this project, I challenged myself to create menu systems that the players can interact with without a traditional menu interface. Instead of having a main menu
              that users need to click through, the game instead starts the player off in a room with pressure plates and other interactable objects. This increases the immersion
              that a player will experience right from the start of when the game is launched. An example of this is a keyboard in the game that players must jump on to name their
              server, as well as play / join games pressure plates that they must stand on to activate.
            </p>

            <p>
              The largest accomplishment in this prototype is the procedural terrain generation. Once a single player game or server is started, hundreds of floating islands are 
              generated using a pre-determined seed (which players will eventually be able to choose). My algorithm can efficiently generate and render about 50 million voxels
              in about 1 minute (hardware dependent).

          <p>If you would like to run the game on your machine, you can download the current playable build using this

            drivers and install UE5 prerequisites to run this game. You will be notified if either of these actions are required when you first attempt to launch the game.

          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of this project was to create a machine learning model that can be trained on patient data while keeping that data private.
            This was done using a federated learning model which consists of multiple "local" clients that can be sent out to hospitals or other medical centres, and a
            single central server that is used to aggregate the individual models once their training is complete. A more in-depth explanation of the federated learning
            model that we created can be found within the project report on my github page. (see "Project Files" below)
          </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aggregation server was able to classify tumours with a max accuracy of ~60% with 4 clients being used. Although this accuracy seems to
          be quite low in this context, this is mostly due to the small size of the dataset that was available, as well as the lack of consistentcy in the data that was fed into
          each of the clients. The datasets included multiple different types of tumours as well as scans from different orientations such as top-down, lateral slices, etc. If the
          data being fed into the clients was more consistent, a much higher accuracy would be achieved. For example, during training, a technician at each medical facility would
          only feed in images of the same orientation such as top-down scans. By installing clients in as many medical facilities as possible, the massive amounts of data being fed
          into the clients would also drastically improve the classification accuracy.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project proved that AI can be used to identify tumours (or other medical conditions) from patient scans without compromising patient data.
